What is Serpentina Arts? Serpentina Arts is a robust roster of Minnesota Latinx visual artists who have a record of creative presence in Minnesota, are innovative participants in coalition-building, and are diverse in age, artistic media, race, genders, sexualities, educational backgrounds, and cultural heritage. The programming values knowledge, reciprocity, and accountability among the participants. Because mainstream arts organizations have largely failed the Latinx visual arts community, Latinx artists are creating their own space through Serpentina Arts programming. Meetings are designed to create a safe place to provide a sense of belonging and decrease social isolation, strengthen artwork through conversations regarding related topics, share artistic accomplishments, and network to share opportunities. Intentional comradeship will motivate solidarity to achieve similar professional aspirations through collective action. -Tina Serpentina Arts Facebook Page Who is Marcos Hernandez Mago?

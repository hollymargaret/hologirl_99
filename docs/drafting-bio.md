# Drafting the Biography
After editing the interview transcript, I put together a biographical narrative that was concise enough to place on a placard next to a hanging peice of art or a quick introduction for an audience at a film festival, yet contained interesting information about the life of the artist. 

## Revisions
Some more correspondence was necessary to gather more information to fill out the gaps in the biography. The artist was happy to cooperate with the various emails and interviews.

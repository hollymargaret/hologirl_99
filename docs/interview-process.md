# Interview Process

The process by which we interviewed our artist for the artist bio is detailed here.

### Conducting the Interview
The interview process was not a traditional in-person interview with Covid-19 precautions in effect, so we decided to conduct the interviews via Zoom video conferencing. 

### Recording the Interview
It was important to get permission from the interviewee before we actually recorded the conversation. Once permission was obtained, we then made sure that the artist understood that they did not have to answer any question that they didn't want to. Familiarity with the Zoom application was important as not recording properly could result in an embarrassing do over.

### Transcribing the Interview
The Zoom application allows you to record and auto transcribe the conversation. This was one benefit of conducting the interview via Zoom over in-person. Once the interview was complete, the transcription of the audio needed to be edited for accuracy. Viewing the recording and comparing against the transcription helped to fix any errors in which the Zoom auto transcribe was inaccurate.

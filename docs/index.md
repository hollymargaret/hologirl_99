## Serpentina Arts Project

As a part of my Writing with Digital Technology class at the U of M Twin Cities, I worked collaboratively with my classmates and an artist community called Serpentina Arts whose goal is to give under represented Latinx artists a platform for exhibition. I spent the fall semester 2021 partnered with a Latinx Artist. Together we developed an artist biography meant to be used in any way the artist saw fit. Here is a link to the [Serpentina Artist Community](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Artist/Serpentina-Arts-123709977640263/) page.

This site contains the process in which we arrived at a finished artist biography. It will cover the following:

* Project overview
* Interview process
* Drafting bio

### About Serpentina Arts
Serpentina Arts is a robust roster of Minnesota Latinx visual artists who have a record of creative presence in Minnesota, are innovative participants in coalition-building, and are diverse in age, artistic media, race, genders, sexualities, educational backgrounds, and cultural heritage. The programming values knowledge, reciprocity, and accountability among the participants.
 
Because mainstream arts organizations have largely failed the Latinx visual arts community, Latinx artists are creating their own space through Serpentina Arts programming. Meetings are designed to create a safe place to provide a sense of belonging and decrease social isolation, strengthen artwork through conversations regarding related topics, share artistic accomplishments, and network to share opportunities. Intentional comradeship will motivate solidarity to achieve similar professional aspirations through collective action. *-Tina (Project Coordinator)*

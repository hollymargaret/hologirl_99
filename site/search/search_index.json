The programming values knowledge, reciprocity, and accountability among the participants. Because mainstream arts organizations have largely failed the Latinx visual arts community, Latinx artists are creating their own space through Serpentina Arts programming. Meetings are designed to create a safe place to provide a sense of belonging and decrease social isolation, strengthen artwork through conversations regarding related topics, share artistic accomplishments, and network to share opportunities. Intentional comradeship will motivate solidarity to achieve similar professional aspirations through collective action. -Tina (Project Coordinator)","title":"Home"},{"location":"#serpentina-arts-project","text":"As a part of my Writing with Digital Technology class at the U of M Twin Cities, I worked collaboratively with my classmates and an artist community called Serpentina Arts whose goal is to give Latinx Artists, who are often under-represented, a platform for exhibition.

Conducting the Interview The interview process was not a traditional in-person interview with Covid-19 precautions in effect, so we decided to conduct the interviews via Zoom video conferencing. Recording the Interview It was important to get permission from the interviewee before we actually recorded the conversation. Once permission was obtained, we then made sure that the artist understood that they did not have to answer any question that they didn't want to. Familiarity with the Zoom application was important as not recording properly could result in an embarrassing do over. Transcribing the Interview The Zoom application allows you to record and auto transcribe the conversation. This was one benefit of conducting the interview via Zoom over in-person. Once the interview was complete, the transcription of the audio needed to be edited for accuracy. Viewing the recording and comparing against the transcription helped to fix any errors in which the Zoom auto transcribe was inaccurate.","title":"Interview Process"},{"location":"interview-process/#interview-process","text":"The process by which we interviewed our artist for the artist bio is detailed here.","title":"Interview Process"},{"location":"interview-process/#conducting-the-interview","text":"The interview process was not a traditional in-person interview with Covid-19 precautions in effect, so we decided to conduct the interviews via Zoom video conferencing.","title":"Conducting the Interview"},{"location":"interview-process/#recording-the-interview","text":"It was important to get permission from the interviewee before we actually recorded the conversation.
